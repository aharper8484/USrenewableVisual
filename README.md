# USrenewableVisual
Percentage of renewable energy generation in the US 2020 - created using R

This was part of a 2nd year University module for Data Science.
As part of a team we chose a case study and broke down the project into individual tasks.
We chose to investigate renewable energy and changes/trends over the last twenty years.
I specifically chose to investigate US on a state by state basis to find any particular trends.
The data was found online and the visual created using R.
